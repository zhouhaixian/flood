# flood
Flood is an open-source, high-performance distributed traffic generation tool specifically designed for stress testing, load testing, and network performance evaluation. Its adaptable configuration allows it to simulate a large number of concurrent user behaviors to conduct massive-scale visits on target systems in order to rigorously test their stability and identify performance bottlenecks.

The project provides a suite of easy-to-use APIs and a rich plugin architecture, supporting HTTP/HTTPS protocols as well as custom ones. Users can tailor request sequences and set various parameters (such as delay distributions and concurrency levels) to accurately mimic complex real-world business scenarios according to actual needs.

Moreover, Flood integrates comprehensive data analysis and visualization capabilities that present test results in real-time, assisting developers in quickly pinpointing issues and refining system architectures. The project adheres to open-source principles, actively encouraging community collaboration in contributions and maintenance, with the aim to become one of the trusted pressure testing solutions in the industry.
